        "\n",

        "can modify notebooks in the md format directly in Jupyter.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "First, install the notedown plugin, run the Jupyter Notebook, and load the plugin:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "pip install d2l-notedown  # You may need to uninstall the original notedown.\n",
        "jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.contents_manager_class='notedown.NotedownContentsManager'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "You may also turn on the notedown plugin by default whenever you run the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "First, generate a Jupyter Notebook configuration file (if it has already been generated, you can skip this step).\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "jupyter notebook --generate-config\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, add the following line to the end of the Jupyter Notebook configuration file (for Linux or macOS, usually in the path `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`):\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = 'notedown.NotedownContentsManager'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "After that, you only need to run the `jupyter notebook` command to turn on the notedown plugin by default.\n",

        "### Running Jupyter Notebooks on a Remote Server\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes, you may want to run Jupyter notebooks on a remote server and access it through a browser on your local computer. If Linux or macOS is installed on your local machine (Windows can also support this function through third-party software such as PuTTY), you can use port forwarding:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "ssh myserver -L 8888:localhost:8888\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The above string `myserver` is the address of the remote server.\n",
        "Then we can use http://localhost:8888 to access the remote server `myserver` that runs Jupyter notebooks. We will detail on how to run Jupyter notebooks on AWS instances\n",
        "later in this appendix.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Timing\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the `ExecuteTime` plugin to time the execution of each code cell in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
        "Use the following commands to install the plugin:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n",
        "jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n",
        "jupyter nbextension enable execute_time/ExecuteTime\n",

        "\n",
        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "* Using the Jupyter Notebook tool, we can edit, run, and contribute to each section of the book.\n",
